# Macular Degeneration Diabetic Edema detectable deep learning model of Optical Coherence Tomography.

EfficientNet model was proposed by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le of Google Research, Brain team in their research paper ‘EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks’.  These researchers studied the model scaling and identified that carefully balancing the depth, width, and resolution of the network can lead to better performance.
It is popularly referred to as eye tomography. It provides visualization of the retinal layer with light waves. 30 million eye tomography scans are performed annually.
